# Survey Application
A simple desktop-based Survey System built using Java, Swing, and MySQL. The system allows users to enter their User ID and proceed to available surveys. The logic is handled through a SurveyController that manages survey retrieval, display, and user responses.

⚠️ Important:
This project will NOT run immediately after cloning.
To execute the application properly, you must configure:

MySQL database connection

JSON configuration files (if used for survey structure/settings)

Required terminal/command-line setup
